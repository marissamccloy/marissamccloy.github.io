#### International Internet Growth
This is a chart that I created with Chartbuilder to show the growth in worldwide internet usage over the past ten years. The chart shows the percentage of the world population that uses the internet from 2008 to 2017. In 2008, approximately 1,463,000,000 people worldwide used the internet. In 2017, approximately 3,885,000,000 people worldwide use the internet.
